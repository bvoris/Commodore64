The Commodore 64 has its own OS and programming language interpreter.
The BASIC v2.0 (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code Version 2) starts at the begining of the load screen.
The following the commands associated with BASIC.
ABS - evaluates to the absolute value (value without the sign) of the given numeric term. 
  Example: PRINT ABS(-10) (Screen: 10)

AND - performs two functions in boolean expressions AND yeilds  the boolean value TRUE; in bitwise operations a bit in the resulting integer is set if and only if the corresponding bits from both integer ters are set. 
  Example 1: PRINT 3>2 AND 5<6
              -1      meaning "true"
  Example 2: POKE 53265,PEEK (53265) AND 247    Bitwise operation to turn off
                                   a single bit in a register
