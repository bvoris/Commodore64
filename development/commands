The Commodore 64 has its own OS and programming language interpreter.
The BASIC v2.0 (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code Version 2) starts at the begining of the load screen.
The following the commands associated with BASIC.
ABS - evaluates to the absolute value (value without the sign) of the given numeric term. 
  Example:    PRINT ABS(-10) (Screen: 10)

AND - performs two functions in boolean expressions AND yeilds  the boolean value TRUE; in bitwise operations a bit in the resulting integer is set if and only if the corresponding bits from both integer ters are set. 
  Example 1:  PRINT 3>2 AND 5<6
              -1      meaning "true"
              
  Example 2:  POKE 53265,PEEK (53265) AND 247    Bitwise operation to turn off a single bit in a register
                                   
ASC - keyword takes the first char of a string and maps it to the numeric index of the Commodore ASCII-table.
  Example:  PRINT ASC("A")
            65
            
ATN - is a mathematical function that returns the arc tangent of a numeric value (the inverse function of TAN). 
  Example:  PRINT ATN(1)
            Output: 0.785398163
          
CHR$ - can be used to convert a number between 0 and 255 into an ASCII character (of string type) and is the inverse function of ASC
  Example:  10 PRINT CHR$(147): REM clear the screen
            20 A$="First name"+CHR$(13)+"Surname": REM adding the <RETURN>-key into the string A$.
            30 PRINT A$: REM output A$
